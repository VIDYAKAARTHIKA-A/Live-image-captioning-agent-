**VISION MATE: SCENE CAPTIONING FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED**

An assistive AI-powered desktop/mobile application that captures real-world scenes using your camera and narrates them in real-time — with special emphasis on traffic and general safety. 

**OVERVIEW:**

VisionMate is an intelligent vision assistant built with YOLOv8 and BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) to help visually impaired individuals understand their surroundings. It captures scenes through a webcam or mobile camera, identifies key objects (e.g., people, vehicles, signals), and generates natural language descriptions with voice narration.

This project is especially designed to assist during road-crossing or traffic navigation, where awareness of vehicles and potential hazards is critical. It also detects dangerous situations and gives alerts.
